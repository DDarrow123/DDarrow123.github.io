Proposal Summary:

 For my final project, I want to build a personal, interactive website that will house an 'About' page and an in-progress 'Portfolio' page along with the main 'Home' page. I want to focus on using special animations that happen either when a page loads or when a user hovers on various elements throughout my three pages. I aim to have the pages look modern, minimal, and professional while making them somewhat fun and entertaining for a user to browse. I've included a few sites throughout the notes that demonstrate the types of animations I want to achieve.

 My ultimate goal to use this site as a jumping off point for my developing front-end web development skills and to use this both to submit to potential employers and to a few bootcamps I am considering for Fall 2018.

 Below you will find notes detailing the features on each of my pages. The mock-up for each page has notes denoted by letters. Each letter of each of these mock-up pages corresponds to same letter in the notes below for the same page.

Thanks!
- Devon


1. HOME PAGE LAYOUT NOTES:

NOTE A:
JS -
'Welcome' text drops down from top center of page to bottom of header bar on page load similar to this page: https://www.stinkstudios.com/

NOTE B:
On 'A' letter hover, image pops up with text: 'About Page'
HTML: On click, user is taken to 'About' page
  B1:
  JS -
  TEXT FOR ABOUT PAGE: Want to try when user hovers on 'A' link, 'bout Page' letters cascade down horizontally, along with pop out image mentioned above

NOTE C:
On 'P' letter hover, image pops up with text: 'Portfolio Page'
HTML: On click, user is taken to 'Portfolio' page
  NOTE C1:
  JS -
  TEXT FOR PORTFOLIO PAGE: When user hovers on 'P' link, 'olio' letters cascade down horizontally, along with pop out image mentioned above

NOTE D:
On 'L' letter hover, social medial icons pop up
HTML: User can click each icon to be directed to my social media pages - separate pages will load in the browser for each link

NOTE E:
LEFT SIDE OF PAGE: As user scrolls down page,  'Devon Darrow' appears on left side
RIGHT SIDE OF PAGE: As user scrolls down page, 'Other Text' appears (still deciding on this text)



2. ABOUT PAGE LAYOUT NOTES:

A:
JS -
'About Me' text drops down from top center of page to bottom of header bar on page load
 - Wanted to play around with rotating text as well similar to this site when a user loads the home page initially: https://www.stinkstudios.com/

B:
JS -
For Mission statement, when user hovers on the 'M' letter, the mission statement text begins in the solid box below it - typewriter function to achieve this. I like how this page utilizes that: https://www.b-reel.com/join-us
  - Thought about playing around with the cascading letters animation here too to spell out the rest of the words: 'Mission Statement', when the user hovers over the 'M' letter - would have to work out timing with statement text


C:
On 'H' letter hover, image pops up with text reading: 'Home Page'
HTML: On click, user is taken to 'Home' page

  C1:
  JS -
  TEXT FOR HOME PAGE: When user hovers on 'H' link, 'ome' letters cascade down horizontally, along with pop out image mentioned above


D:
User can scroll through each of the images that represent a personal interest
  - Want to play with types of layouts for the horizontal scroll. I like how this website does it: https://www.firstborn.com/approach

E:
On 'I' letter hover, text pops up reading: 'Interests'

F:
JS -
As user scrolls right through each image, text appears over the image the user is currently viewing. When the user slides to the next image, new text relevant to that image appears over it etc. etc.

G:
On 'L' letter hover, social medial icons pop up
HTML: User can click each icon to be directed to my social media pages - separate pages will load in the browser for each link

H:
JS -
Sidebar for slideshow - brief blurb about me and my professional experience
  - Want to play around with animating this in some way if there is time



3. PORTFOLIO PAGE LAYOUT NOTES:
- Note: As the portfolio is a work in progress and I don't have a whole lot of material currently, I am playing around with animations and placeholders to demonstrate my grasp of JavaScript as detailed below until I can add more substantive work to my website.

A:
JS  -
On page load, '3. Work in Progress' drops down to bottom of header bar.

  A1:
  Typewriter function commences below drop down detailing a brief summary of projects typing across page from left to right

B:
On 'L' letter hover, social medial icons pop up
  HTML: User can click each icon to be directed to my social media pages

C:
On 'H' letter hover, image pops up with text reading: 'Home Page'
  HTML: On click, user is taken to 'Home' page
    C1:
    JS -
    TEXT FOR HOME PAGE: When user hovers on 'H' letter link, 'ome' letters cascade down horizontally, with pop out image mentioned above  
D:
JS -
On hover, text appears: "Insert Mind-Blowing Project" - use typewriter function to type out letters going across solid square from left to right

D1:
JS -
On hover, text appears: "Another placeholder for a second mind-blowing project" - use typewriter function to type out letters going across solid square from left to right

D2:
JS -
On hover, text appears: "Yet another placeholder for a third mind-blowing project" - use typewriter function to type out letters going across square from left to right
  - May decide only to do one portfolio placeholder square to simplify the page and save time

E:
JS - 
On hover, typewriter function starts typing out contact email address. User clicks this to pop-up email on personal laptop with the 'mailto:' feature that will be built into the code.
