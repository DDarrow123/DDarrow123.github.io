Proposal Summary:

 For my final project, I want to build a personal, interactive website that will house an 'About' page and an in-progress 'Portfolio' page along with the main 'Home' page. I want to focus on using special animations that happen either when a page loads or when a user hovers on various elements throughout my three pages. I aim to have the pages look modern, minimal, and professional while making them somewhat fun and entertaining for a user to browse. I've included a few sites throughout the notes that demonstrate the types of animations I want to achieve.

 My ultimate goal to use this site as a jumping off point for my developing front-end web development skills and to use this both to submit to potential employers and to a few bootcamps I am considering for Fall 2018.

 Below you will find notes detailing the features on each of my pages. The mock-up for each page has notes denoted by letters. Each letter of each of these mock-up pages corresponds to same letter in the notes below for the same page.

Thanks!
