For my final project, I wanted to build a personal, interactive website that houses an 'About' page and an in-progress 'Portfolio' page along with the main 'Home' page. I wanted to focus on using special animations that happen either when a page loads or when a user hovers on various elements throughout my three pages. I aimed to have the pages look modern, minimal, and professional while making them somewhat fun and entertaining for a user to peruse. 

 My ultimate goal to use this site as a jumping off point for my growing front-end web development skills and to submit the site to potential employers once I've iterated on and enhanced the site with future portfolio projects.


Thanks!
